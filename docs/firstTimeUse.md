# First Time Use

If this is the first time you power up your digital Tape Recorder or if
you have moved to an other WiFi network this is how you should proceed:

1.  If the digtital Tape Recorder is unable to connect to a (known) WiFi Network it wil start it's own WiFi Access Point.

2.  Connect your computer (tablet, phone) to the Access Point created by the digitale Tape Recorder.  The name is something like: `kimDTR-xx:yy:zz` where "xx:yy:zz" is part of it's MAC address.

3.  Start your browser and type the URL `192.168.4.1`.

4.  You will now see a window where you can select your WiFi network and fill-in the network password

5.  The digital Tape Recorder should now start-up again and connect to your WiFi network

Thats it!

You can now enter the URL `kimdtr.local` and see the GUI of the digital Tape Recorder.

You can also connect to the digital Tape Recorder with telnet (`telnet kimdtr.local`).
