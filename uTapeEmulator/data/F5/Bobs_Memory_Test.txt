This memory test was originally based on Jim Butterfield's
memory test program in the First Book of Kim, but has
grown a bit.

This now tests every memory location using a rolling 9-bit
pattern.  Ie the pattern repeats every 9 bytes, so this
will detect most shorted address line problems.  I use
this to test memory boards, so it will run forever unless
an error is detected.  At the end of each pass, a '.' is
printed.

This does output to the TTY port, so if you're only using
the default KIM display, the output functions will need to
be tweaked.  Not hard to do, but I didn't need it.

Written February 2006 by Bob Applegate, but it uses some
bits of code from Jim Butterfield, and Ross Archer
