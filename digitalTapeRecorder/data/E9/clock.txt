Clock [KIM-1]
by Charles Parsons

This clock routine uses KIM's built in interval timer with the interrupt option.  It works by loading $F4 into the timer (/1024) each time the non-maskable interrupt (NMI) occurs.  This theoretically produce a time of 249,856 microseconds or just under 1/4 second.  
The adjustment to 1/4 second is done with the timer (/1) in the interrupt routine.  A fine adjustment of the clock can be made by modifying the value in location $0366.  
Only two subroutines will be documented here (escape to KIM & hour chime) but many more can be added by simply replacing the NOP codes starting at $03DE with jumps to your own subroutines.  For instance, a home control system could be set up using the clock program.

The escape to KIM allows kim to run without stopping the clock.
This means that you can run other programs simultaneously with the clock program unless your program also needs to use the NMI (such as single step operation) or if there could be a timing problem (such as with the audio tape operation).  Pressing the KIM [GO] button will get you out of the KIM loop.

To start the clock:

      1.  connect PB7 (A-15) to NMI (E-6).
      2.  initialize NMI pointer (17FA, 17FB) with 60 and 03.
      3.  set up the time and AM-PM counter locations in page
          zero.
      4.  go to address $03C0 and press [GO].

To get back into the clock display mode if the clock is running - start at location $03C9.

NOTE:  These routines are not listed in any particular order so be watchful of the addresses when you load them.
