This program implements the word guessing game "hangman" for 6502 based computers. The object of this game is to guess the word selected from the supplied list. This is done by entering a letter (A-Z) in response to the prompt "guess? ". If that letter is in the selected word the computer will print the word showing the location of that letter. Letters not yet guessed will be indicated by "-". If more than one of that particular letter is in the word only the first occurence of the letter is displayed. For each incorÂ¬rect guess the computer will display one more letter of the word "hangman". When the word "hangman" appears completely you lose and the word is then revealed. You are then asked to "Play again?". The appropriate responses are y or n. If n is typed control will be transferred to your monitor. The word list supplied can be easily modified to suit your needs. The list starts at "wrdlst" (0397) and each word is preceeded and followed by hex code 04. Each word can be up to 9 letters long with one ascii character in each byte. If the number of words is changed (listing is supplied with 16) the value of "wrdcnt" must also be changed. That is, you must change the contents of location 025A to reflect the number of words (in hex) in the list. After any word is used it is marked to preclude the possibility of it occuring more than once in a particular game. When all words have been used the computer will appear to hang just before printing the number of letters in the word. This your indication that it is all done. To play again you must then reload the word list or the whole program. To disable the marking of the used words change location 0278 to EA (nop), before starting this program you must be certain that not both bytes rndm and rndm+1 are zero. If so, set one or both to some non-zero value. The starting address of this program is 0200.
