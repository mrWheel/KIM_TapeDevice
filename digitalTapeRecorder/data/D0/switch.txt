Switch
This program implements a game of skill and logic called 'Switch' for the 6502 computer. The object of this game is to rearrange a random sequence of the numbers 1 to 9 to numerical order left to right. This is done by reversing the sequence of the first n numbers where n is the response to the prompt "SWITCH?" by reversing sequences of appropriate length (in the proper order) the re-ordering can be achieved in a maximum of 15 moves regardless of the initial randomness. Before starting the program you must be certain that not both bytes rndm and rndm+1 are zero, if so, set one or both to some non-zero value. The starting address of this program is 0200. Good luck!
