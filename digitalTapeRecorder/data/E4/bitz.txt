Bitz
BY JIM BUTTERFIELD

A teaching program which drills you on binary and
hexadecimal numbering schemes.  It's kind of fun
just as a speed test.

Start the program at 0200 and you'll see eight bits
on the left side of the display.  Some of the bits
are in the lower position, meaning 'off' or zero.
Others will be in the top row, where they mean 'on'
or logic one.

All you have to do is translate those bits into hexadecimal
notation, and enter the hex value.  For example, if all
bits happen to be 'on', the number you'd enter is FF;
or if all the bits were 'off', you'd enter 00.
KIM rewards a correct answer with another problem.

If you're not yet at ease with the concept of bits
and how they relate to hexadecimal numbering, a few
runs of this program will help a lot.
