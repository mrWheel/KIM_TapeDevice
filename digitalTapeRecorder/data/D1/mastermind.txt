Mastermind
This program implements the popular Mastermind. The object of this game is to guess a sequence of 4 letters in the range of A-F that the computer-has selected. The computer will give you clues as to the accuracy of your guess as follows. One black marker for each letter guessed in the correct position. One white marker for each letter guessed in the sequence but not in the correct position. The total number of markers (black + white) will never exceed 4 because the computer will award at most one marker for each position of the user's guess. When you receive 4 black markers you have guessed the sequence and the computer will inform you as to how many tries you needed. If you give up, you may type a 'G' as one of of your guesses and the computer will tell you what the sequence was. Caution must be excercised so that not both bytes rndm and rndm+1 are zero. If this is the case, change one or both bytes to some value (non-zero) before you begin running the program. The starting address of this program is 0200. Have fun!
