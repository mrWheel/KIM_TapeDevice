Hurkle

This game is adapted for the 6502 from the version released by the Peoples Computer Company. The object of the game is to find the hiding hurkle. He will be hiding on a 10x10 grid with o,o being the southwest corner of the playing field. You will have three guesses to find him! To start the game, start execution at hex location 0200. You will then be asked for an initial guess. If you didnt find him the computer will give you a clue, telling you which direction you need to go to find him. For example, if you guessed 2,3 and the hurkle was hiding at 6,6 you would be told to go north east. The first number entered moves you north or south (increasing values move you north) and the 2nd number moves you east or west (increasing numbers move you east). If you cant find him in 3 guesses, you will be told where he was hiding. Happy hurkle hunting !!
