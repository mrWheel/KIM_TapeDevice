Farmer Brown
by Jim Butterfield

You are farmer brown. you are growing a beautiful crop of corn but the following animals try to come and steal your corn:

         -  -  -         -  -  -  -  
          |  |          |       |   
           -  -  -       -  -  -   
                           |    | 
 -                             
ant      bird              cow  

 -           -  -  -  -  -      -
| |    |    |          |       | |
 -  - -      -     -            -  -  -  -
   |   |    |  | |   | |          |    |
    - -         -     -            -  -
   dog        elephant            fox

As soon as you see one of these animals coming for your corn, you can scare it away by calling its name. Press the button with the first letter of the animal's name. So you would press A to shoo away an Ant, B to shoo away a Bird, and so on.

If you press the right button, the animal will go back. If you press the wrong button, it will think you mean somebody else and keep coming for your corn. And when all your corn is gone, kim will show 000 and the game is over.

The animal won't "shoo" unless it has completely entered the display. Speed of the animals can be adjusted by changing the contents of location 026A.

Exercises:

1. You can see that each animal occupies 6 memory locations, starting at 02AA (the Ant) - and the last location must always be zero. Can you make up your own animals? The letters may not fit exactly, but you can always invent names or use odd ones (you could make an Aardvark, a Burfle, a Cobra, and so on).

2. The game might be more fun if the animals went faster after a while, so that sooner or later they would just zip by.  The location that controls speed is at address 026A; the lower the number, the faster the animals will go.  So if you could arrange to have the program decrease this number automatically once in a while, you'd get a nice speed-up feature.

3. You can't "shoo" the animal until it's completely entered the display; but you can still catch it after it's partly left. The game would be harder - and maybe more fun - if you could only shoo it while it was completely in the display. Hint - testing location 005F (window-1) would tell you if an animal was on its way out.

4. You'd have a "target practice" game if you made the animal disappear (instead of backing up) when you pressed the right button. with a little planning, you'll find that this is quite easy to do.
