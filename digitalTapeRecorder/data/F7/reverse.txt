Start at 0200 - the display will show a combination of 6 letters such as CDBAEF.  Hit a number from 2 to six to 'flip' letters.  For example, if you hit 2 with the previous example, the first two letters will flip over to give DCBAEF.  Now if you hit 4, you'll get the winning combination - ABCDEF - and the display will signal your win with a line of dashes.

The computer won't limit your number of flips - but try to get a win in 6 moves or less,  By the way, the computer forbids doing the same flip twice in succession - so you can't back up a move.
