Multi-Maze
by Jim Butterfield

Description:  
Find your way out of the maze.  You are the flashing light in the centre of the display.  As you move up (key [9]), down [1], left [4] or right [6], KIM will keep you in the central display;  You'll see the walls of the maze moving by as you travel.  Like walking through a real maze, you'll only see a small part of the maze as you pass through.

If you can get out, you'll find yourself in a large open area; that means you've won.  Press [GO] at any time for a new maze.  

Program starts at address 0200.
