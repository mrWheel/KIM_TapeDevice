WUMPUS
By Stan Ockers

Start program at $0305 (or $0316)

Description -
Wumpus lives in a cave of 16 rooms, (labeled 0-F).
Each room has four tunnels leading to other rooms, (see the figure).  When the program is started at 0305, you and Wumpus are placed at random in the rooms. Also placed at random are two bottomless pits (they don't bother Wumpus, he has sucker-type feet) and two rooms with Superbats, (also no trouble to Wumpus, He's too heavy). If you enter a bat's room you are picked up and flown at random to another room.  You will be warned when bats, pits or Wumpus are nearby   If you enter the room with Wumpus, he wakes and either moves to an adjacent room or just eats you up (YOU lose)  In order to capture Wumpus, you have three cans of "mood change" gas. When thrown into a room containing Wumpus, the gas causes him to turn from a vicious snarling beast into a meek and loveable creature. He will even come out and give you a hug. Beware though, once you toss a can of gas in the room, it is contaminated and you cannot enter or the gas will turn you into a beast (you lose).
If you lose and want everything to stay the same for another try, start at 0316. The byte at 0229 controls the speed of the display. Once you get use to the characters, you can speed things up by putting in a lower number. The message normally given tells you what room you are in and what the choices are for the next room. In order to fire the mood gas, press PC (pitch can?), when the rooms to be selected are displayed. Then indicate the room into which you want to pitch the can. It takes a fresh can to get Wumpus (he may move into a room already gassed) and he will hear you and change rooms whenever a can is tossed (unless you get him). Good hunting!

The program is adapted from a game by Gregory Yob which appears in The Best of Creative Computing.

Corrections:
If Wumpus moves to a room containing a pit or superbats, he will be hidden and you won't be told when you are near him. You must either guess his location or make him move again by pitching a can.
