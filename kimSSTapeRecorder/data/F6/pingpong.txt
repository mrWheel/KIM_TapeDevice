Ping Pong
Jim Butterfield

Play against the computer, or change the program for a two-player game.  On each shot, you choose between four plays:  Spin, Lob, Block, or Slam.  If you're playing the left side of the court, use the left-hand buttons (0, 4, 8 and C).

See the diagram below:

        C  slam  F
        8  block B
        4   lob  7
        0  spin  3

Each shot has its own strengths and weaknesses:  for example, a Slam is a powerful shot, but it's also likely to be "fluffed".  Strategy is not trivial - your chances of success on any play depend not only on your choice of shot, but on what shots have gone before.  You'll have to learn the combinations the hard way.

You'll see the net in the middle of the court.  Don't try to play the ball until it is on your side of the net, or you'll lose the point.  Each type of shot has a distinctive appearance, which you'll learn to recognize.  They are similar to the key positions:  a Spin lights the bottom segment, a Lob lights the middle segment, a Block lights the upper segment, and the mighty Slam shot lights all three segments and travels faster.

The original version of the game was published for the HP-67 calculator in "65 Notes", V4N2P5.  Authorship was not given.

At first, the shots will come too fast for you to cope with.  There are two ways to solve this.  The easy way is the "freeze" the ball by holding down any unused key, like AD or 7:  play will be suspended until you figure out what you want to do next.  The harder way, but not too hard, is just to slow down the ball by changing the program:  locations 0331 to 0334 contain the speeds for each type of shot.  Increase these values and the ball will slow down, e.g., 40 40 40 28 will halve the speed.

For a two-player game, where KIM does not play the right side, change location 032C to 01.  
To have KIM play the left side, change location 032B to 00.

KIM plays a strong game, but CAN BE BEATEN!
