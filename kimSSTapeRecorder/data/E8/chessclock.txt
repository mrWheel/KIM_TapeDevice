Chess Clock        
by Cass Lewart

The program starts at location 0200.  

Two independent clocks are operated by the two players by depressing keys 1 or 2 respectively.  
The right two digits show the move number, the left four digits show minutes and seconds.

Maximum time is 99 minutes 59 sec.  

The clock program can be finely tuned by changing the value of word 027F, increase by 1 slows the clock by approximately 6 sec/24 hours and vice versa.
