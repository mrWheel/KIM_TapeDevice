DIRECTIONS -

     THE COMPUTER HAS CHOSEN FOUR LETTERS, ALL OF WHICH ARE 
A,B,C,D,E, OR F.  LETTERS MAY BE REPEATED - FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE COMPUTER'S "SECRET COMBINATION" MIGHT BE CACF OR BBBB.
     YOU GET TEN GUESSES. EACH TIME YOU GUESS, THE COMPUTER 
WILL TELL YOU TWO THINGS: HOW MANY LETTERS ARE EXACTLY CORRECT 
(THE RIGHT LETTER IN THE RIGHT PLACE); AND HOW MANY LETTERS 
ARE CORRECT BUT IN THE WRONG POSITION.
     FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE COMPUTER'S SECRET COMBINATION IS 
CBFB AND YOU GUESS BAFD, THE TWO NUMBERS WILL BE 1 AND 1 
(THE 'F' MATCHES EXACTLY; THE 'B' MATCHES BUT IN THE WRONG PLACE).
THESE NUMBERS WILL SHOW ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE DISPLAY; 
THE CODE YOU ENTERED WILL APPEAR ON THE LEFT.
     MAKE A NOTE OF YOUR GUESSES AND THE COMPUTER'S RESPONSES. 
WITH A LITTLE MENTAL WORK, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BREAK THE 
CODE EXACTLY IN SEVEN OR EIGHT WORDS. A CORRECT GUESS WILL 
PRODUCE A RESPONSE OF '4-0'. IF YOU DON'T GUESS RIGHT IN 
TEN MOVES, THE COMPUTER WILL GIVE YOU THE ANSWER.
     AFTER A CORRECT GUESS, OR AFTER THE COMPUTER TELLS YOU 
THE ANSWER, IT WILL START A NEW GAME (WITH A NEW SECRET CODE) 
THE INSTANT YOU TOUCH A NEW KEY.
