BANDIT (AKA SLOT MACHINE)

Start the Program at 0200 and on the right, you'll see the $25
   that KIM has given you to play with, The funny symbols on the
   left are your "wheels" - hit any key and see them spin.

   Every time you spin the wheels by hitting a key it costs you $1.
   When the wheels stop, you might have a winning combination,
   in which case you'll see money being added to your total
   on the right. Most of the time, you'll get nothing ...
   but that's the luck of the game.

   The biggest Jackpot is $15:  that's three bars across the
   display. Other combinations pay off, too; you'll soon learn
   to recognize the "cherry" symbol, which pays $2 every time
   it shows in the left hand window.

   There's no house percentage, so you can go a long time on
   your beginning $25. The most you can make is $99; and if
   you run out of money, too bad;  KIM doesn't give credit.
